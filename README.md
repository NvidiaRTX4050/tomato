## 🌟 The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo:

1. 🎯 Choose a task
2. ⏰ Set the timer for 25 minutes
3. 💪 Work until the timer rings
4. ☕ Take a short break (5 minutes)
5. 🔄 Repeat
6. 🌴 Take a longer break (15-30 minutes) after 4 pomodoros
